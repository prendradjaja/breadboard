a game using this framework needs:
    some game code?
    some ui code?

class Game:
    can maintain state in any way it wants, but must have
    status is WAITING_FOR_0, _1, or SEEKING_OPPONENT. should not actually modify it
    def __init__() -- initialize to starting state
    def apply_move(Move) -- returns CONTINUE | WIN | LOSE
    def is_valid_move(Move)
    e

class Move:
    can contain any data it wants, but must have
    player is 0 or 1

UI code listens to:
    invalid move
    your turn
    opponent turn
    win
    lose

UI code sends:
    make move # received by local framework code FOO

FOO:
    if valid move and correct player:
        apply
        switch players (status)
        NOTIFY opponent turn or win or lose
        SEND make_move(move)
    else:
        NOTIFY invalid move

client has to know about:
    game data ??
    which player i am

server has to know about:
    tables { -- indexed by table_id as well as client_ids
        player client ids
        game data ??
        seeking_opponent()
    }

[ ] client:
    if no table_id (hashtag):
        player = 0
        SEND create_table()
    else:
        player = 1
        SEND join_table(table_id)

[ ] server create_table():
    make_table_id()
    create table, put in hash table, index by table_id and client_id
    SEND table_created(table_id)

[ ] client table_created(table_id):
    redirect
    NOTIFY waiting_for_opponent

[ ] server join_table(table_id):
    if table exists and status == SEEKING_OPPONENT: # this is player 2
        add to hash table
        status = WAITING_FOR_0
        SEND to both players: ready()
    else:
        todo (deal with nonexistent tables and player 3?)

[ ] client ready():
    if player == 0:
        NOTIFY your_turn
    else:
        NOTIFY opponent_turn

[ ] server make_move(move):
    find the table from the client id
    verify sender is correct player (and game has started) via status
    verify valid move
    apply move, which changes status
    SEND to other player: opponent_move(move)

[ ] client opponent_move(move):
    apply move
    NOTIFY your_turn or win or lose
